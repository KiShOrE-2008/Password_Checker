# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer (Python)

A security-focused Python CLI tool that evaluates password strength using realistic entropy modeling, human-pattern detection, and real-world crack-time estimation — not misleading length checks.

Built for cybersecurity learning, secure coding practice, and defensive security demonstrations.

## 🚀 Why This Project?

Most password checkers give false confidence. This tool takes a realistic attacker mindset, combining entropy math with common human password weaknesses.

If you're learning cybersecurity, this project shows you actually understand password security — not just regex rules.

## ✨ Features

### 🔒 Secure Input & Hashing
- Hidden password input using `pwinput`
- Optional password reveal
- PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- 128-bit random salt
- 100,000 iterations
- Timing-safe hash comparison

### 📊 Realistic Strength Analysis
- True entropy calculation (log₂)
- Character pool estimation
- Unique character ratio penalty
- Pattern-based entropy reduction

### 🧠 Human Pattern Detection
Detects common weaknesses:
- Character repetition (aaaa, 1111)
- Sequential patterns (abc, 123)
- Keyboard patterns (qwerty, asdf)

### 📈 Clear Strength Visualization
- ASCII strength bar
- Color-coded output
- Strength levels:
  - Very Weak
  - Weak
  - Moderate
  - Strong
  - Very Strong

### ⏱️ Real-World Crack Time Estimation
Crack time is estimated across multiple attacker models, not a single misleading number:

| Attack Scenario | Guess Rate |
| :--- | :--- |
| Online (rate-limited) | 100 guesses/sec |
| Online (no limits) | 1,000 guesses/sec |
| Offline (PBKDF2 hashes) | 10,000 guesses/sec |
| Offline GPU (worst case) | 1,000,000,000 guesses/sec |

> [!WARNING]
> Crack times are theoretical estimates, not guarantees.

## 🧠 How Strength Is Measured

Passwords are evaluated using:
- Length (minimum recommended: 8)
- Uppercase characters
- Lowercase characters
- Numbers
- Special characters
- Entropy calculation (log₂)
- Unique character ratio
- Pattern penalties (repetition, sequences, keyboard layouts)

### 📊 Strength Classification

| Entropy (bits) | Rating |
| :--- | :--- |
| < 30 | Very Weak 🔴 |
| 30 – 44 | Weak 🔴 |
| 45 – 59 | Moderate 🟡 |
| 60 – 79 | Strong 🔵 |
| ≥ 80 | Very Strong 🟢 |

python password_checker.py
```

### Program Flow
1. Enter password (hidden input)
2. Optional password reveal
3. Secure hashing (PBKDF2)
4. Strength analysis
5. Entropy, strength bar, crack times, and warnings displayed
6. Improvement suggestions shown (if needed)

## 📸 Sample Output

```text
Entropy: 58.7 bits

Password Strength:
[██████████████████------------] 58% (Moderate)

Estimated Crack Times:
- Online (rate-limited): 1.9 days
- Online (no limits): 4.6 hours
- Offline (PBKDF2): 23 seconds
- Offline GPU (worst case): Instant

Pattern Analysis:
- Sequential pattern detected (123)

Overall Strength: Moderate
```

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Crack times are theoretical
- No dictionary or breached-password checks
- CLI only (no GUI)
- Not intended for production authentication systems

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- [ ] Dictionary & leetspeak detection
- [ ] Breached-password database checks
- [ ] Markov-chain entropy modeling
- [ ] GUI / Web interface
- [ ] Modular Python package
- [ ] Configurable password policy engine
